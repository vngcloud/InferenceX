[`infx/klaud/reporting.py`](../infx/klaud/reporting.py) owns the schemas, arithmetic and rendering. The agent supplies concise observations and verified evidence, not hand-calculated deltas. The PR body contains only the goal and baseline. Comments own attempts; the lifecycle receipt owns verified completion. Keep English visible and put Simplified Chinese in one collapsed `<details><summary>中文</summary>` section. Numeric tables appear once; Chinese prose refers to those tables. Apply this layout to lifecycle comments too. No mentions, review requests, raw logs, private telemetry or limitations section.

## Commands

Run from the checkout with the candidate environment provided by the workflow:

```bash
KLAUD=(uv run --no-project --exclude-newer PT12H --python 3.12 \
  --with 'pydantic>=2.10,<3' --with pyyaml python -m infx.klaud)

# goal.json: {"en":"Update ENGINE image from `OLD` to `NEW`.","zh":"将 ENGINE 镜像从 `OLD` 更新为 `NEW`。"}
# Resolve the display model name from the public OpenAPI document first.
"${KLAUD[@]}" prepare-baseline --model 'DISPLAY MODEL NAME' \
  --goal-file "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/goal.json" --output "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/baseline.json"

# After creating the real-change draft PR, publish the baseline before GPU work.
"${KLAUD[@]}" report --kind baseline --file "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/baseline.json"

# Read the schema once and reuse the local record for each attempt's updates.
"${KLAUD[@]}" report-schema --kind attempt > "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/attempt-schema.json"
"${KLAUD[@]}" report --kind attempt --file "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/attempt.json"
```

`prepare-baseline` queries public `benchmarks` with the selected date, `exact=true`, and no calculator view; `workflow-info` establishes producer IDs, heads and attempts. It reconstructs the selected family from each producer's YAML with trusted local generator code, including the historical `.github/configs` layout and flat runner-label format. Only that family is validated, so retired sibling schemas cannot break reconstruction. Matching requires the old image and full public workload/topology/concurrency identity; supplied recipe fingerprints must also match. Legacy rows without fingerprints require a unique match and a producer changelog selecting the family. Rows outside the reconstructed family are ignored even when their producer metadata is incomplete. Missing provenance on a matching current or historical point, ambiguous identities and duplicate points stop preparation instead of publishing an incomplete baseline. Before the first publication, supplement verified published evals and dataset provenance using [the public API routes](./klaud.md#public-api-investigation). `BenchmarkRow` has no dataset identity; unproven AgentX datasets still produce N/A deltas. Never run the old image to fill a gap.

The baseline file is created once; retries do not refetch it. The first baseline comment freezes the typed record. Conflicting replacement records are rejected. A correction requires a maintainer to review the evidence and make the correction explicit; do not silently revise the baseline during repairs.

Freeze **every point in the original selected public baseline**. The helper unions the current family with the original producer families; it does not filter the public feed to the selected observation's ISL/OSL. Historical 1k/1k points therefore remain required even if today's family only contains 8k/1k. Missing published metrics remain N/A without deleting those points. Never shrink the baseline to overlapping points or the body preview. Preserve each recipe/workload/topology/concurrency/dataset identity; equal counts or extra points elsewhere do not replace missing points.

Create the draft body with `<!-- klaud-baseline -->`. The helper replaces that placeholder once, preserving anything other bots append outside it. If publication is interrupted after the baseline comment but before the body update, retrying the same record completes the body update. Later attempt reports never rewrite the body. Large reports write immutable content-addressed parts before updating their index, so an interrupted update cannot mix revisions.

Comparison keys come from `reporting.point_key()` on the canonical generated point, excluding only image, point name, producer fingerprint and queue metadata. Preserve workload, topology, concurrency and all remaining settings. `reporting.values()` reads collector/API metrics and converts seconds to milliseconds. Do not invent an alias or key to make two points match. Dataset identity must match independently for AgentX. Missing/zero baselines, failed points and mismatched datasets/statistics produce N/A. Throughput change is `(new / old - 1) * 100`; eval scores are normalized to 0–1 and differences shown in percentage points, matching suite, metric, shape and sample counts.

Each attempt records its owned run ID, exact head and run attempt, kind/number, status, en/zh sentences for change/next, separate expected/passed benchmark and eval counts, all points and evals. The goal also uses en/zh sentences naming the engine and exact old/new images. Optional finding text stores diagnostic evidence; neither finding nor coverage counters are rendered. Keep failures, cancelled points and request errors visible. Initial update is number 0; repairs are 1–5. Confirmed transient infrastructure retries have their own kind and do not consume a recipe repair; the prompt bounds these to two per attempt. Do not call a failed eval a passed smoke because throughput passed.

Publish immediately after dispatch and before waiting. Update that run/attempt's comment on material changes or after 30 minutes; retain completed attempt history. Large records are split into numbered comment parts without dropping points or limiting the family size. The compact body shows up to 12 baseline rows; all rows and provenance persist in baseline comments. Reports are idempotent by parent/candidate/run/attempt. Only the typed public record is persisted, never the full scratch directory or execution transcript.

Use compact metadata lines, exact `8k/1k` shorthand and shared settings above the tables. Only collapse point labels to concurrency when the displayed workload/topology/statistic is shared and concurrencies are unique; otherwise retain distinct full labels. Cells contain the new value and parenthesized delta. Eval samples show `N each` only when both counts match; otherwise show old/new counts. Keep failures, request errors and reasons for unavailable comparisons as short notes. No Result column, Coverage/Finding paragraphs, legends, storage boilerplate or redundant status summary. Next names only the next subgoal. English content stays visible, including all result tables; only Chinese is collapsed.

`finish` generates the final report from verified artifacts and the frozen baseline for both normal execution and interrupted-session recovery. It publishes the report **before** marking ready. Missing historical baseline data is explicitly N/A; it never invents deltas or launches a replacement baseline. A successful sweep may contain regressions; readiness means work and validation are complete, not that every metric improved. Klaud neither authorizes reuse nor merges the PR.

## Final preflight and maintainer retry

Before adding `full-sweep-enabled`, validate the exact pushed head's full matrix:

```bash
head_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
uv run --no-project --python 3.12 --with 'pydantic>=2.10,<3' --with pyyaml \
  python utils/process_changelog.py --base-ref origin/main --head-ref "$head_sha" \
  --changelog-file perf-changelog.yaml > "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/final-matrix.json"
"${KLAUD[@]}" check-final --matrix-file "$KLAUD_EVIDENCE/final-matrix.json"
```

The verifier independently generates the unfiltered family from exact-head YAML with trusted helper code. It compares full recipe settings using the workflow's matrix schemas, which account for defaults added after fingerprinting; changed settings with a copied fingerprint still fail. An equivalent scenario filter can pass; an omitted/changed point or default eval cannot. It does not execute downloaded PR code. Generator-policy drift on an old run requires inspection rather than silently weakening validation.

`check-final` also checks **every frozen baseline point** against the canonical final family before dispatch. `finish` and interrupted-session recovery apply the same check after validating full artifact coverage, before readiness. A missing baseline or omitted/changed original point fails validation even if the smaller current-family sweep is green. Report the affected points and call `finish` with `outcome: failed` to clean up owned runs and close the PR; never mark it ready or validated. `N/A` permits an unproven delta, not a missing updated-image result. Targeted smoke subsets remain allowed. Existing maintainer-handoff and branch-retention rules still apply.

After a confirmed blocker is fixed, a repository maintainer may explicitly release a closed candidate's retained branch:

```bash
"${KLAUD[@]}" release-candidate --parent-run-id PARENT_RUN_ID \
  --candidate-file ORIGINAL_CANDIDATE_JSON --head REVIEWED_CLOSED_PR_SHA
```

This rejects the Klaud account and non-maintainers. It requires a completed parent, verified cleanup receipt, closed/unmerged exact-head PR and terminal owned children, rechecks the branch, records approval, then deletes only that retained branch. It does not relaunch, erase historical results or take over an open PR. Ordinary capacity/readiness deferrals already release their branches through `finish`.
