# Agentic trace replay benchmark for Kimi-K3 (MXFP4) on B300 using vLLM with
# DSpark speculative decoding at level 2, probabilistic drafting, synthetic
# acceptance pinned to the committed golden AL (real verification for evals).
#
# MEASURED, for anyone reading the throughput numbers: this draft head's REAL
# acceptance collapses on the agentic corpus. Its native window is 32k
# (rope_parameters yarn, factor 32, original_max_position_embeddings 32768,
# stretched to the declared 1M), and at the corpus's 100k-330k ISL the measured
# acceptance length is 1.16-2.01 with 13-41% position-1 acceptance -- versus 4.18
# AL and 0.826 position-1 on short-context work under the identical image, draft
# and spec config. Synthetic acceptance is the AgentX-prescribed way to measure
# system performance at a fixed acceptance target (see the SPEC_CONFIG block), so
# these throughput numbers are NOT evidence that the draft predicts well at
# agentic context lengths. It does not.
#
# MTP sibling of kimik3_fp4_b300_vllm.sh. Everything about the target server is
# identical; the deltas are:
#   - --speculative-config  method "dspark", draft Inferact/Kimi-K3-DSpark,
#                           attention_backend FLASHINFER_MLA,
#                           draft_sample_method probabilistic,
#                           rejection_sample_method block
#   - cudagraph capture sizes are expressed in TOKENS, not sequences
#
# Required env vars:
#   MODEL, TP, CONC, KV_OFFLOADING, TOTAL_CPU_DRAM_GB, RESULT_DIR, DURATION
#
# TP8 is the only single-node layout. The MXFP4 checkpoint is ~1.5 TB on disk;
# at TP4 that is ~375 GB of weights per GPU against B300's 288 GB of HBM, so
# only the full 8-GPU shard (~188 GB/GPU) fits. Do not add TP4/TP2 arms.
#
# Chat formatting: AGENTS.md requires MTP scripts to pass --use-chat-template to
# run_benchmark_serving. Agentic recipes never call it -- the replay drives
# AIPerf against /v1/chat/completions, so prompts are already chat-formatted and
# spec-decode acceptance is measured on chat-shaped inputs. Nothing to add here.

# ---- DSpark speculative decoding -------------------------------------------
# Probabilistic drafting at DSpark level 2, with synthetic acceptance pinned to
# the committed golden AL, per the AgentX policy in
# golden_al_distribution/README.md: "a submission may choose any supported draft
# length, but it may not substitute a different acceptance target", because
# "InferenceX is evaluating inference-system performance, not the ability to
# fine-tune a benchmark-specific speculative head". AL is workload-dependent by
# the README's own admission, so the prescribed acceptance -- not the acceptance
# this corpus happens to produce -- is what makes submissions comparable.
#
# Level 2 rather than 7. Draft length IS ours to choose, and the verify width is
# a real system cost that synthetic acceptance does not remove: at K=7 the target
# verifies 8 positions per step, which loses to no-speculation once the GPU
# saturates even at the forced golden AL of 3.84. Using cost ~ 1 + m(K-1) + f,
# K=2 clears break-even at both ends of the m range while K=3 is a wash at
# saturation and K=7 is negative:
#     K=2  golden AL 2.51  ->  ~1.7x low conc, ~1.2x saturated
#     K=3  golden AL 3.00  ->  ~1.7x low conc, ~0.95x saturated
#     K=7  golden AL 3.84  ->  ~1.3x low conc, ~0.54x saturated
# The drafter's KV footprint (~25% of GPU KV) is unaffected by K and remains a
# genuine cost of running spec decoding at all on 100k+ prompts.
