# KLAUD_DEBUG.md — Operational Knowledge for Recipe-Bump PRs

A running playbook of failures the Klaud-Cold image-bump cron has hit, the diagnoses, and the fixes/workarounds applied. **Read this first** before debugging a new failing claude/* PR — most failure modes here recur.

When you fix something not yet listed, add it here so the next session doesn't re-learn it.

## 1. PR setup-stage failures

### 1.1 `perf-changelog.yaml`: deletion-not-allowed
**Symptom:** the `setup` job fails before any sweep runs with
```
ValueError: Deletions are not allowed in /home/runner/work/InferenceX/InferenceX/perf-changelog.yaml.
Only additions to the changelog are permitted. Found deleted line: ...
```
**Root cause:** Cron-PR branches go stale; when main merges new changelog entries, the PR's local snapshot of `perf-changelog.yaml` no longer covers them, so the validator sees the missing lines as deletions. A naive rebase can also strip trailing whitespace from unrelated entries — same effect (e.g. `pr-link: ...1311  ` → `pr-link: ...1311`).

**Fix (canonical):**
```bash
# In the PR's worktree, after `git merge origin/main` conflicts on perf-changelog.yaml:
git checkout origin/main -- perf-changelog.yaml          # take main's bytes verbatim
cat >> perf-changelog.yaml <<EOF                          # then append THIS PR's entry at tail

- config-keys:
    - <recipe-key>
  description:
    - "<one-line summary>"
  pr-link: https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/pull/<N>
EOF
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('perf-changelog.yaml'))"
```

Do **not** try a 3-way merge of `perf-changelog.yaml` — whitespace edits will silently re-trigger the deletion check.

After committing and pushing the resolution, the synchronize run checks the
changelog with the same matrix processor used by setup, then checks the reuse
authorization. This catches deleted history or malformed appended entries
before reuse can skip setup. `utils/merge_with_reuse.sh <PR>` performs the push
and waits for the PR checks automatically.

## 2. vLLM v0.21.x / v0.20.x: GPU OOM at model-load

**Symptom:** vLLM workers OOM during weight loading or right after warmup:
- `HSA_STATUS_ERROR_OUT_OF_RESOURCES: Available Free mem : 0 MB` (AMD)
- `torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. ... GPU N has X GiB of which Y MiB is free` (NVIDIA)
- vLLM may also log `_check_enough_kv_cache_memory` failing with **negative** available bytes (e.g. `-25.24 GiB`).

**Root cause:** v0.21.0 (and v0.20.2+) enabled an aggressive CUDA-graph memory profiler that pre-reserves a large chunk of VRAM up front (~30% on B200), shrinking effective `--gpu-memory-utilization` well below what the flag says. Old SHA-pinned custom images had a smaller footprint, so the recipe's existing `0.95` setting now starves the KV cache.

**Fix:** in `benchmarks/single_node/<recipe>.sh`, either:
1. **Lower `--gpu-memory-utilization`** (`0.95 → 0.90`, sometimes 0.85). Matches the H100/H200/B200 NVIDIA pattern. Smallest blast radius.
2. **Disable the profiler entirely** for cases where lowering isn't enough: `export VLLM_MEMORY_PROFILER_ESTIMATE_CUDAGRAPHS=0` before `vllm serve`. Matches `benchmarks/single_node/agentic/kimik2.5_fp4_b200.sh:65`.

Seen on: #1395 (kimik2.5-fp4-b200-vllm — needed env var), #1403 (gptoss-fp4-mi300x-vllm — needed 0.90), #1461 (dsv4-fp8-h200-vllm — needed 0.90).

### 2.1 DEP CUDA-graph capture OOM on GB300

**Symptom:** TP1 + data/expert-parallel decode workers load successfully and
allocate the KV cache, then fail in `breakable_cudagraph.py` at
`torch.cuda.graph.capture_end()` with `CUDA error: out of memory`. Large GB300
VRAM does not prevent this because vLLM fills the configured memory budget with
KV cache before capturing hundreds of persistent graphs.

**Root cause:** `max-num-seqs` and `max-cudagraph-capture-size` were sized from
global benchmark concurrency instead of per-DP-rank concurrency. MiniMax-M3
DEP4/DEP8 recipes requested capture sizes of 4096-8192 and up to 4096 sequences,
creating 358-806 graphs per GPU.

**First-line tuning:** keep `gpu-memory-utilization: 0.90`, but size graph limits
to the per-rank load. For the GB300 MiniMax-M3 sweep, use
`max-num-seqs: 512` and `max-cudagraph-capture-size: 2048` on DEP decoders.
This matches the single-node GB300 recipe and still covers the largest 512
requests per DP rank. If capture still OOMs, lower decode
`gpu-memory-utilization` to `0.85`.

Seen on: #1735 (MiniMax-M3 MXFP8 GB300 dynamo-vLLM).

## 3. Custom DSV4 image → generic v0.5.12 OOMs

**Symptom:** DSV4 recipes work on their SHA-pinned `lmsysorg/sglang:deepseek-v4-hopper@sha256:...` (or `deepseek-v4-b300`, `deepseek-v4-blackwell`) custom builds, but OOM on weights load when bumped to the generic `v0.5.12-cu130` release tag. Example: DSV4-Pro FP8+MTP weights consume ~125.43 GB / 141 GB per H200, leaving `-4.05 GB` for KV cache.

**Root cause:** The custom DSV4 images use a different weight layout / EAGLE draft handling that fits in less memory than the generic release. The release tag isn't a drop-in replacement.

**Fix:** keep DSV4 recipes pinned to their custom SHA-pinned image until upstream sglang gains the same DSV4-specific weight handling. Bumping to the generic tag is currently NOT viable.

Seen on: #1460 (dsv4-fp8-h200-sglang+mtp).

## 4. Upstream sglang v0.5.12 B300 regressions

Three distinct upstream regressions on NVIDIA B300 (Blackwell Ultra, `sm_103` — compute capability 10.3) shipped in `lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.12-cu130`. (sm_120 is for *consumer* Blackwell / RTX 50 series, not B300 — don't propagate that.)

### 4a. DeepGemm TMA-descriptor crash (GLM-5-FP8)
**Symptom:** CUDA graph capture aborts with `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS (700)` at `/deepgemm/csrc/.../runtime_utils.hpp:143` on the **first batch size** for **every TP rank**. Server never serves a prompt.

**Workarounds (any one):**
1. `--fp8-gemm-runner-backend cutlass` to bypass DeepGemm via CUTLASS.
2. `export SGL_ENABLE_JIT_DEEPGEMM=0` before `python -m sglang.launch_server` to skip JIT DeepGemm.
3. Pin recipe to `lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.11-cu130`.

Filed upstream: sgl-project/sglang#25551. Seen on #1421.

### 4b. trtllm GEMM bug at bs=128 + MTP / EAGLE (GLM-5-NVFP4)
**Symptom:** EAGLE draft CUDA graph capture crashes immediately at the largest batch size with `RuntimeError ... trtllm_batched_gemm_runner.cu:276 ... numBatches=256, GemmMNK 128x1024x6144`. The target model captures fine; only the draft model crashes.

**Workarounds:**
1. Cap `--cuda-graph-max-bs` and `--max-running-requests` to 64 in the launch script to avoid the bs=128 trigger.
2. Comment out the MTP/EAGLE scenarios on B300 in the recipe.
3. Pin to v0.5.11-cu130.

Filed upstream: sgl-project/sglang#25563. Seen on #1420.

### 4c. flash_attn SM-arch assertion (qwen3.5-bf16)
**Symptom:** All 4 TP workers AssertionError on first forward pass:
```
File "/opt/venv/.../sglang/srt/layers/attention/flashattention_backend.py:..."
  assert sm_100 <= arch <= sm_110f
```
B300 is `sm_103` (compute capability 10.3, Blackwell Ultra) — which is *nominally inside* the asserted `sm_100..sm_110f` range, yet the assertion still fires. Best guess is the cute kernel's `Arch.sm_110f` set only matches the architecture-specific feature-flag variants it was compiled for (e.g. `sm_100`, `sm_100f`, `sm_110`, `sm_110f`) and `sm_103` / `sm_103a` isn't in that explicit list. Server never becomes healthy; warmup times out at 600s.

**Fix:** Needs an sglang image with `flash_attn` that recognises `sm_103` / `sm_103a` — no local workaround. Pin to `v0.5.11-cu130` in the meantime.

Seen on #1422.

## 5. Cluster infrastructure (AMD MI355X / MI300X / MI325X)

### 5.1 `mia1-p01-g09 / g19 / g37` (amd-tw-mi355) — persistently drained
- **g09**: `pyxis is broken`
- **g19**: `Kill task failed (JobId=N StepId=N)`
- **g37**: `permission issues with GHA runner workflows : Not responding` (down since Mar 2026)

If a sweep job lands on any of these, it'll never start. Nothing to do at the recipe level — these stay drained until ops fixes them.

### 5.2 `mia1-p01-g11 / g12 / g31` — docker socket perms
**Symptom:** mi355x jobs fail with `permission denied while trying to connect to the docker API at unix:///var/run/docker.sock` during the `docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)` cleanup step, cascading into SLURM job expiration.
**Fix:** ops needs to fix docker group / socket perms on these nodes. Recipe-level workaround: none.

### 5.3 `chi-mi300x-049` — `/nvme_home` disk-full
**Symptom:** pyxis container extraction fails with `No space left on device` writing to `/nvme_home/gharunner/.local/share/enroot/pyxis_*/opt/rocm-*/...`. The `/nvme_home` partition is hosted under `/` on this node and has been chronically near-full.

**Fix already landed:** `runners/launch_mi300x-amds.sh` now pins salloc to only known-good mi300x nodes (`chi-mi300x-[034-036,054,057-058]`) — see PR #1462. `chi-mi300x-049` is held in `State=DOWN` by a watchdog on the controller (`/home/gharunner/_audit/drain_049_watchdog.sh`) that re-applies the drain every 10s if SLURM auto-clears it (which it does on dynamic-norm nodes).

### 5.4 `chi-mi325x-pod1-017` — orphaned port-8888 process
**Symptom:** sglang server bind fails with `[Errno 98] Address already in use` on port 8888. Held by an MLPerf accuracy run started outside SLURM.
**Fix:** SSH to controller, find the holder via `ss -tlnp | grep :8888`, `kill` the PID. If recurring, file with the team running MLPerf experiments.

### 5.5 Cluster controller layout
- **amd-vultr-mi300**: SLURM controller for 7 mi300x nodes (3 down, see 5.3).
- **amd-vultr-mi325**: SLURM controller for 6 mi325x nodes.
- **amd-tw-mi355**: jumpbox → ssh further to compute nodes (`mia1-p01-gNN`). 12 nodes (3 drained, see 5.1).
- `/home` is NFS-mounted across clusters from `chi-mi325x-pod1-001:/nfs/homes`, **root-writable**.
- `/tmp` and `/nvme_home` are per-node local; HF cache lives at node-local `/raid/hf-hub-cache/` (2.7T per mi300x node).
- Use `srun -w <FQDN>` (with the **full FQDN**, not the short hostname) from the controller to run admin commands on a compute node.

### 5.6 Drain watchdog pattern
SLURM auto-clears `State=DRAIN` on `DYNAMIC_NORM` nodes when they re-register. To keep a node out of the pool sticky-style, use `State=DOWN` AND start a watchdog:
```bash
# on the controller, as root
nohup bash -c '
  while true; do
    s=$(scontrol show node <FQDN> 2>/dev/null | grep -oE "State=[A-Z+_]+")
    if ! echo "$s" | grep -qE "DOWN|DRAIN"; then
      scontrol update NodeName=<FQDN> State=DOWN Reason="watchdog" >/dev/null 2>&1
    fi
    sleep 10
  done
' > /home/gharunner/_audit/drain_<node>_watchdog.log 2>&1 &
```
Doesn't survive controller reboots — for permanent removal a SLURM admin should edit `slurm.conf`.

## 6. Docker image tag gotchas

**Don't invent a "release" tag pattern from a date-suffixed nightly.** `lmsysorg/sglang-rocm:v0.5.12-rocm720-mi35x` does **not** exist — only the dated `v0.5.12-rocm720-mi35x-20260517` does. All MI355X `sglang-rocm:rocm720` tags follow the dated-nightly pattern.

Before bumping an image, verify the target tag exists:
```bash
curl -sI "https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/lmsysorg/sglang-rocm/tags/v0.5.12-rocm720-mi35x"
# 200 → exists; 404 → doesn't
```

Or check whether any other recipe on main uses the proposed tag — if zero uses, suspect.

---

## 7. CI: rerun mechanics

- `gh run rerun <id> --failed` only works when the workflow run is **completed** with `conclusion=failure`. If the run is still `queued`/`in_progress`, the call returns "cannot be rerun".
- To abandon an in-flight run and start fresh, push an **empty commit** to the PR branch:
  ```bash
  git commit --allow-empty -m "Re-trigger sweep"
  git push
  ```
  The old run will be auto-cancelled by `workflow/cancel-sweep-on-merge` (provided the head SHA changed).
- For a `cancelled` run (not `failure`), use `gh run rerun <id>` without `--failed` to re-run everything.

### 7.1 Reuse after matrix-generation policy changes

Reusable source artifacts are authoritative. The merge-time
`reuse-ingest-artifacts` job validates that downloaded artifacts are readable,
non-duplicated, and internally consistent, but it does not require them to
match a matrix regenerated from the merge commit. A generator-policy change
between the PR sweep and merge therefore does not require another GPU sweep.

Raw and aggregate eval identities must still match, as must agentic point/raw
artifacts and summaries. Batched eval identities come from
`completed_eval_concs`, so an explicitly pinned failed run may reuse only the
points it completed. Missing or invalid metadata, duplicate identities, and
raw/aggregate disagreement still fail reuse.

---

## 8. gh CLI gotchas

- **`gh pr edit` silently aborts** on a Projects-classic deprecation GraphQL error. Title/body updates won't apply. Use `gh api -X PATCH "repos/<org>/<repo>/pulls/<N>" -f title="..." -F body=@file.md` instead.
- Same issue for adding labels — use `gh api -X POST "repos/<org>/<repo>/issues/<N>/labels" -f "labels[]=<name>"`.
- `gh pr view ... --jq .headRefName` output can have a trailing `\r`. Strip it: `gh pr view <N> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName | tr -d '\r\n'`. Otherwise shell concatenation produces `branchunners/launch_mi300x-amds.sh`-style corruption.
- `gh pr list --json statusCheckRollup` **truncates** each PR's rollup — never trust it for per-check filters. Re-query each PR individually with `gh pr view <N> --json statusCheckRollup`.
- `gh` and the GitHub Actions API: `conclusion` is `""` (empty string, not `null`) for in-flight checks, so `jq`'s `// .status` fallback doesn't trigger. Use:
  ```jq
  def state: if (.conclusion // "") != "" then .conclusion else .status end;
  ```

---

## 9. PR conventions for this repo

- Image-bump / new-recipe PRs I open on behalf of the user (or that the user creates) get the **`[Klaud Cold]`** title prefix.
- Add the `full-sweep-enabled` label so a canary-gated full sweep actually runs (`gh api -X POST ... labels[]=full-sweep-enabled`). Use `non-canary-full-sweep-enabled` instead only when the single-node canary is flaky or unrepresentative; it runs the full sweep without the canary gate. Without one of the sweep labels, the sweep is mostly SKIPPED.
- After any code change that shifts a PR's scope (drops a recipe, changes an image tag), **update the PR title AND body in the same step** and **verify** with `gh pr view <N> --json title,body` — `gh pr edit` silently fails (see §8).
- `utils/merge_with_reuse.sh <N>` is the merge entrypoint; it handles the `perf-changelog.yaml` auto-append.

---

## 10. Useful slash commands (defined in `.claude/commands/`)

- `/find-mergeable-claude-prs` — lists `claude/*` PRs whose full sweep finished all-green.
- `/list-claude-pr-status` — lists READY/RUNNING (and optionally FAILED) state per `claude/*` PR.
- `/fix-klaud-cron-prs` — diagnoses failing `claude/*` PRs by reading their failed job logs.
- `/merge-prs <N> [<N>...]` — sequential merge via `utils/merge_with_reuse.sh`.

Each command file is self-contained; read them to understand the exact jq filters they use.
