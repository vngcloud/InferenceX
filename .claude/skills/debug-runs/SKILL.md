# Debug runs (tight feedback loop)

Use this when the goal is to get a **full-sweep config passing** — and you want to verify
on the actual nodes first (tighter loop than the full CI dispatch cycle), or to debug
node/infra issues, or just to gather context on a cluster.

This composes with the other skills: use **`/nuke`** (or `/add-model-hardware`) to create
the PR(s) with the image bump + perf-changelog entry + `full-sweep-fail-fast` label; this
skill is the **monitor → root-cause → fix → re-verify → merge-gate** loop that follows.

## Cluster access — read it from the canvas, never hardcode it

Login addresses, runner users, runner directories, jumpboxes, and weight/squash staging
paths live in an access-controlled **InferenceX Clusters** Slack canvas, NOT in this repo
(to avoid publicizing infra). The canvas link is intentionally not stored here:

> **If you are a SemiAnalysis employee**, ask the user for the Slack link to the InferenceX
> Clusters canvas and read the access details from there.

Before SSHing to a cluster, look up that cluster's row in the canvas for: **login address**,
**GHA runner user**, **runner directory**, any **jumpbox / ProxyJump**, whether it's
**Slurm or bare-metal**, and the **per-node host RAM**. The matching
`runners/launch_<cluster>.sh` is the source of truth for the exact container image mounts
and the benchmark command.

- If you **can't read the canvas** (no Slack access, or unsure), **ask the user** for the
  cluster's SSH target + runner user rather than guessing or pasting infra into the repo.
  If this is a **fork** (i.e. not the SemiAnalysis upstream, where the canvas won't apply),
  ask the user to replace this skill with their own fork's runner/cluster access
  information.
- A SemiAnalysis operator may also have these as `~/.ssh/config` aliases — prefer those if
  present.

## Inputs

- The **config-key(s)** in scope, e.g. `dsv4-fp4-b300-vllm`, and their SKU/cluster.
- The **PR / branch** under test (if driving an existing PR), or the recipe files to change.
- The **merge bar**: 100% of sweep jobs green **and** a real throughput gain (see Merge gate).

## The loop

### 1. Trigger (or reuse) the sweep

A PR's sweep is kicked by labels or a `/sweep` comment:

- **`full-sweep-fail-fast`** — full sweep that bails on first failure per matrix (faster signal while debugging; **strongly recommended default**, and what `/nuke` attaches).
- **`full-sweep-enabled`** — full GPU sweep that runs every job to completion despite failures; use only when a flaky job killing its matrix's in-flight results is unacceptable.
- **`/sweep …`** PR comment (Slash Command Sweep) — re-trigger / reuse a sweep run without a new commit.

For a **single config** (tightest CI loop, skips the rest of the matrix), dispatch e2e directly:

```bash
gh workflow run e2e-tests.yml -f generate-cli-command="test-config --config-key <KEY> --config-file <PATH/to/master.yaml>" -f test-name="debug <KEY>"
```

(`generate-cli-command` is the required input; `--target` is NOT a real arg.)

### 2. Monitor continuously

Find the run, then watch it — don't poll by hand. Prefer the **Monitor** tool with a
filter that catches both progress and failure signatures so silence never reads as success.

```bash
# Sweep run for a PR's head commit
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view <PR> --repo SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --repo SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX --workflow "Run Sweep" --commit "$HEAD_SHA" --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
gh run watch "$RUN_ID" --repo SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX --interval 30
```

When monitoring several runs at once (e.g. 4 SKUs), track them by `databaseId` and report
each as it lands — never declare success from absence of output.

### 3. Root-cause a failure

```bash
gh run view "$RUN_ID" --repo SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX --json jobs \
  --jq '.jobs[] | select(.conclusion=="failure") | "\(.databaseId)\t\(.name)"'
gh run view "$RUN_ID" --repo SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX --log-failed > /tmp/sweep_failed.txt
```

Grep large logs for the real signature before reading context (~50 lines around each hit):
`Error`, `Traceback`, `RuntimeError`, `CUDA`, `HIP`, `OOM`, `assert`, `connection refused`,
`exit code`, `failed to launch`, `NCCL`, `RCCL`, `timeout`. State the suspected root cause
in one or two sentences before changing anything.

### 4. Tight loop: reproduce on the node directly

This is the point of the skill — instead of re-dispatching CI for every hypothesis, get on
the box and reproduce the **single** failing config.

Why this is tighter: under e2e / the matrix, **each concurrency / config runs against its
own freshly-spun engine** (a new server per matrix job). On the node you can spin up a
**single** server once and fire many requests / sweep multiple concurrencies against it —
far faster iteration when you're probing behavior or tuning, since you skip a fresh model
load per data point.

Steps:

1. Look up the cluster's access + which node ran the failing job (from the job name / runner
   name) in the canvas; SSH in (use `ssh -A` when a jumpbox/agent-forwarding is involved).
2. Reproduce the exact benchmark the launcher runs — read `runners/launch_<cluster>.sh` for
   the image, container mounts, and the `benchmarks/single_node/<...>.sh` command + env
   (`IMAGE`, `TP`, `PRECISION`, `EXP_NAME`, `SPEC_DECODING`, …). On Slurm clusters that's a
   `salloc`/`srun` with the squash image; on the **bare-metal `-tw` pools it's `docker run`**
   on the node directly (no `srun`).
3. **Always diff against a working node / working SKU** for reference — most node failures
   are environment drift (driver, ROCm/CUDA, missing mount, stale squash image), not code.
4. Iterate on the node until the single config passes, then push the fix and re-run CI.

**Entering the live container on a Slurm cluster.** When a benchmark job is already running
and you want to poke at its actual container (same image, mounts, env) rather than spin a
new one, attach to it:

```bash
squeue -u <runner-user>                     # find the JOB_ID for the running benchmark
srun --overlap --jobid=<JOB_ID> --pty bash  # land on the allocated node (or just ssh to the node if you have direct access)
enroot list -f                              # find the running container's PID
enroot exec <pid> bash                      # drop into the container
```

(On the bare-metal `-tw` pools there's no Slurm/enroot — use `docker ps` + `docker exec -it <id> bash`.)

**Node-level fixes are in scope** when you have operator access (e.g. AMD nodes where you
have sudo) — but **ask the user before executing any of them** (see guardrail below). The
kinds of fixes that are on the table: bringing a node's environment in line with the
working reference, and — if one or two nodes are unrecoverable — **draining them** or
explicitly **ignoring them in the run script** rather than blocking the whole sweep. Note
any such change in the report.

> `rocm-smi`/`nvidia-smi`, `sinfo`/`squeue`, `df`, env, config inspection) is fine. But

### 5. Flakes: rerun, don't relaunch

If a job flaked (infra, transient network, runner pickup) rather than a real failure, rerun
just the failed jobs on the existing run — don't dispatch a fresh sweep:

```bash
gh run rerun "$RUN_ID" --repo SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX --failed
```

### 6. Report results — do NOT merge

**Never merge.** Merging is the user's call — only merge if the user **explicitly** tells
you to in this session. Even when everything looks perfect, stop and report; do not
admin-merge on your own judgment.

Report the two things the user will decide on:

1. **Sweep status** — is it 100% of full-sweep jobs passing (green), or fail-fast-truncated / partial?
2. **Perf delta** vs the most recent official `main` run for that SKU. Compare against the
   latest main results — e.g. on inferencex.semianalysis.com
   (`https://inferencex.semianalysis.com/inference?...&i_active=<sku>_<engine>`) or the
   stored results for that SKU's last main `run-id`.

Present green-ness + the perf comparison, then **wait for the user** to decide whether to merge.

## Final report

Per config-key: final state (green / failing / flaky), root cause(s) found, node-level
changes made (and any nodes drained/ignored), and the perf delta vs main. Link the run(s)
and PR(s). End by asking the user whether to merge — do not merge yourself.
