"""FlashInfer one-sided NVLink EP: the transport a GB200/GB300 deployment actually runs.

The GB SKUs are an NVLink-only domain, and vLLM selects a different all-to-all there than it
does on an RDMA fabric: `--all2all-backend deepep_v2` for RDMA, `flashinfer_nvlink_one_sided`
for NVLink. Benchmarking the GB racks with DeepEP V2 and NCCL EP therefore measured transports
no deployment would choose on that hardware. This adapter closes that gap.

ONE-SIDED, not two-sided. The sibling `flashinfer_nvlink_two_sided` backend is deliberately not
wired: it produces gibberish output on GB200/arm64 (vllm#39722). One-sided means the initiator
writes straight into the target's workspace and then sets a flag — on MNNVL, where peer memory
is directly addressable across the 72-GPU domain, that degenerates to ordinary stores over the
fabric with no rendezvous, which is exactly why it wins on this topology.

Upstream surface (flashinfer.comm.trtllm_moe_alltoall):

    MoeAlltoAll(mapping, max_num_tokens, top_k, num_experts,
                workspace_size_per_rank=..., mnnvl_config=...)
    .dispatch(token_selected_experts, input_payloads, runtime_max_tokens_per_rank)
        -> list of [ep_size, runtime_max_tokens_per_rank, *] workspace-backed receives
    .combine(payload, runtime_max_tokens_per_rank, output=...)
        -> [local_num_tokens, elements_per_token]

Three properties of that API shape this adapter:

  * Strict phase pairing. `dispatch` asserts "called twice without combine", `combine` asserts
    the phase is "dispatched", and the internal state resets after each combine. So a timed
    combine needs a fresh dispatch and a timed dispatch needs a draining combine — the same
    contract MoRI and the DeepEP V2 low-latency path already declare.
  * A PADDED receive. Dispatch returns `[ep_size, runtime_max_tokens_per_rank, hidden]`, not a
    compact buffer, so every oracle view must read valid slots only. Padding is untouched
    workspace memory; reading it would feed garbage to the correctness gate.
  * `runtime_max_tokens_per_rank <= max_num_tokens`, so the workspace is sized once from the
    ladder maximum and each call passes the current rung.

`normal` mode only. FlashInfer exposes one one-sided A2A kernel family, not a separate
decode-optimized one, so there is no honest `low-latency` cell to add: an `ll_backends` row
here would re-measure the same kernel under a mode that promises a different one. The decode
phase is still covered — `normal` runs the full decode and prefill ladders.
